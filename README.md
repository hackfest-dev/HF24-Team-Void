# Sport Biomechanics in the Metaverse

## Problem Statement
Develop computer vision software for sport biomechanics in the metaverse to analyze athlete movements, enhance performance, guide coaching, and prevent injuries through real-time image processing during sporting activities.

## Solution: Intelligent Data Capture
Our software leverages computer vision to capture athlete movement data in real-time or from recordings, seamlessly integrating with cameras or wearable sensors in both metaverse training environments and real-world sporting arenas.

### Actionable Insights Through Feature Extraction
By extracting key features like joint angles, velocities, and accelerations, we translate movement data into actionable insights that empower coaches and athletes to optimize performance.

### Proactive Injury Prevention
We go beyond performance analysis by utilizing movement patterns to predict potential injury risks. This allows coaches and athletes to take preventative measures, reducing downtime and ensuring long-term well-being.

### Real-time Coaching Advantage
By providing coaches with real-time feedback and data-driven insights, our software empowers them to tailor training programs for individual athletes, maximizing their potential.
